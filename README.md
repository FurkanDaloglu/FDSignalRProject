## The Purpose Of The Project And What Needs To Be Done For Its Development

The QR Code Order Management Project aims to enable customers to scan the QR code of the table in the restaurant using Asp.Net Core Api and SignalR to place orders and perform other transactions.

The first step to be taken in the project is to generate a QR code for each table, and these QR codes will be scanned and placed into the system. When a customer sitting at the table scans the QR code with their phone, the menu will open using the table's ID, and the orders placed will be recorded under that table ID.

You can find innovative ideas for what else can be done in the project in the Yapƒ±lacaklarListesi.txt file in Turkish and support the project.
